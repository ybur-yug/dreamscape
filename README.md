# Setup
## Beginning
#### These instructions are for Ubuntu 15.04. YMMV on other OS's
To start, run `setup_part_1.sh`

Next, if you want to utilize the gpu (much faster) we will need to set up and install CUDA. This is not
trivially scriptable, but you can find precise directions and downloads [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/#axzz3f2tBHDG9).

Now, `setup_part_2.sh` is good to be ran.
